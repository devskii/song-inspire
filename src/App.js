        Welcome to SongInspire! Need help getting inspired in your songwriting?
        Ever look at the blank piece of paper in front of you and not know where
        to start? Here at SongInspire, we believe the best way to spark
        inspiration is to introduce constraints on your song. They will be your
        guardrails, giving you a space in which to create.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use this app to select any number of constraints. To give yourself a fun
        challenge, somewhere to start. Then write your song with that constraint
        applied! For example, you could say, "All right, I'm going to write a
        song at 120bpm."
      </p>
      <p>
        All selections are random, so there's a ton of variety you can harness
        in your creative endeavors!
